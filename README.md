This repository provides Python code blocks to check if a given input is a `decinteger`, `octinteger`, `hexinteger`, or a `string literal`.

1. **DecInteger**
   - Run the block and enter an input to check if it is a decinteger or not.
   - Example: `1000`

2. **OctInteger**
   - Run the block and enter an input to check if it is an octinteger or not.
   - Example: `0o234`

3. **HexInteger**
   - Run the block and enter an input to check if it is a hexinteger or not.
   - Example: `0x1f2e`

4. **String Literal**
   - Different methods for checking string literals are commented out at the bottom.
   - Uncomment to run the method of your choice.
